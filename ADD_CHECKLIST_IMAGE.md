# How to Add the Checklist Image

To add the checklist image to your home page:

1. **Save the image file** you provided (the one with three clipboards and green checkmarks)
2. **Name it**: `checklist-image.png`
3. **Place it in**: `public/checklist-image.png`

The code is already set up to use this image. Once you add the file, it will automatically display on the home page.

## Alternative: If you already have the image with a different name

If the image is already in your `public/` folder with a different name (like a hash name from Figma), let me know the filename and I can update the code to use it.
